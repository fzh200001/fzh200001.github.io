This project conducted a case study and scenario modelling exercise for utilities facing electricity rate hikes under the energy transition. The analysis integrated strategies for optimizing electrification cost distribution across different types of energy end-users. It further examined the impacts of rising demand factors such as EV charging, rooftop solar adoption, and the rapid expansion of AI data centers on load patterns and marginal costs. Particular attention was given to the potential role of battery storage in stabilizing the grid during peak demand. Building on these findings, the project delivered policy and operational recommendations supported by demand function estimation and real-world examples, including the use of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) financial incentives, time-of-use (TOU) rate plans, battery storage construction, and multilateral negotiation approaches.
