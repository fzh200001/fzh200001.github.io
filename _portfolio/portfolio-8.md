title: "Proximity, Development, and Environment: The Role of Remoteness in Shaping China’s Air Pollution Patterns"
excerpt: "Using satellite-based NO₂ data and land use controls, this study shows that remote Chinese counties face higher pollution from economic activity, with governance capacity and political events shaping regulation intensity.<br/>

Economic development - urbanization and industrialization - is linked to distance to provincial capitals in China. However, the intensity of air pollution regulation is not directly correlated with pollution levels. Instead, it depends on how many resources the local government can mobilize for governance. Due to the biased official data issue, our research uses remote sensing techniques to examine if the remoteness of the county affects the local pollution level. We first confirm a positive association between proximity to provincial capitals and economic development using cross-sectional data. Then we utilize near real-time, high-resolution NO2 concentration data from the Sentinel-5P satellite as a proxy for air quality, investigating whether pollution levels in more remote regions are less regulated. To control for the effects of built environments, we incorporate land use data from the Dynamic World dataset to isolate industrial activities from other living-related emissions. Our findings reveal that remote counties experience higher pollution levels due to economic and industrial activities, while significant political events like the 20th CPC National Congress and extra transportation convenience like accessibility to nearby ports have mitigation effects.
