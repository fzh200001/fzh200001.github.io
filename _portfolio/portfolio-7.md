This project investigates the causal impact of primary seat belt enforcement on traffic fatalities across U.S. states from 1983 to 2012. Seat belt usage is widely recognized as a key factor in reducing crash-related deaths, and this research exploits staggered adoption of primary enforcement laws as an exogenous policy shock. Using multiple-period difference-in-differences with two-way fixed effects, the analysis finds that seat belt laws reduce traffic fatalities by about 86 deaths annually per state after controlling for demographic, economic, and policy factors. Robustness checks with event-study estimators confirm that the strongest effects occur within the first five years after implementation, with the impact fading thereafter. These findings highlight the importance of policy design and sustained enforcement strategies to ensure the long-term effectiveness of traffic safety laws.
