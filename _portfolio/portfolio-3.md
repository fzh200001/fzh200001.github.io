This memo analyzes the risks associated with importing cotton products from China under the UFLPA, which presumes any cotton products sourced in whole or in part from Xinjiang, China are sourced with forced labor and subject to seizure at the border by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Utilizing trade data visualization and risk analysis, the memo identifies low-risk and higher-risk countries based on their dependency on Chinese cotton exports and their contribution to US imports. Recommendations include short-term adjustments to reduce imports from high-risk countries and long-term strategies to partner with low-risk countries, seek reliable certifications, diversify supply chains, and build a comprehensive risk-management framework.
