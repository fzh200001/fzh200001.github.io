This brief explores the impact of King County’s fare reinstatement during the COVID-19 pandemic on ridership as well as differential effects across income groups. Our analysis finds that average ridership decreased by 6\% after fares were reinstated. Interestingly, ridership appears to have declined the most among high-income riders, likely because they had more transportation options at their disposal to avoid the fare reinstatement. However, these results were not confirmed by statistical tests. More data is necessary to examine differential effects of the fare reinstatement on income groups and affirm the hypothesis that ridership declined most for high-income individuals.
