Whether a restaurant opens or closes depends on several market factors, yet, McDonald’s has managed to become a global icon since their initial opening in the early 1940s. Furthermore, since 2014, they have also managed to double not only their prices but also their income.1 2 In light of these accomplishments, this project anticipates the existence of an underlying strategy to McDonald’s franchise expansion. In other words, as the number of McDonald’s stores has increased globally, McDonald’s has managed to successfully gain and retain market share, and this report seeks to highlight potential factors McDonald’s takes into consideration when contemplating approving a franchisee in a new area. In addition to providing an understanding of a major corporation’s business strategy, these findings can be helpful in the following ways: They can help government officials better understand which areas will likely not experience increases in fast-food chain job opportunities. They can help aspiring smaller food chains avoid areas of major competition. These findings can also help identify any predatory business practices adopted by McDonald’s. In other words, these findings may be important to not only businesses but also everyday consumers and policymakers.
