This study examines the influence of land certification on the rural-urban migration dynamics in China, amidst significant rural land use policy reforms and the extensive implementation of a land certification program in the 2010s. Utilizing household-level data from various Chinese communities, the research hypothesizes that land certification encourages rural inhabitants to migrate to urban areas seeking employment. By analyzing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) spanning 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 through a Difference-in-Differences approach and a two-way fixed effect model, the study uncovers a notable positive effect of land certification on rural-urban migration. The findings suggest that land certification provides the necessary security and economic leverage for rural residents to pursue labor mobility. This research contributes significantly to understanding the complex relationship between land certification and migration, offering insights for policy development and further investigation into land use and migration patterns.
