Welcome! I’m **Zhuohan Fang**, an Analyst at The Lantau Group in Shanghai, where I focus on China’s power sector and electricity market reforms.  
I hold a Master of Public Policy from UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy, and a Bachelor's degree in Agricultural Economics from Zhejiang University.

My research interests lie broadly in **international trade**, **environmental economics**, and **industrial policy**, especially how global value chains interact with the energy transition.  
I'm currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2026 in public policy, political science, and agricultural economics.

Previously, I worked on projects related to:
- Clean energy commodity trade in Indo-Pacific region under political economy context
- Environmental degradation and adaption in Southern California
- China's self-reliance industrial and innovation policy in cutting-edge technology fileds

Feel free to explore my research, CV, and writing samples through the menu above. Thanks for visiting!
